Edit the file `assignment-1.Rmd` and insert your R code where wherever you see the string "INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE"

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Question 1

a) Use the `seq()` function to create the vector $(2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \ldots, 44)$. Note that each term in this sequence is of the form 
$2 + 3n$ where $n = 0, \ldots, 14$.

```{r}
seq(from = 2,to = 44,by = 3)
```

b) Use `seq()` and `c()` to create the vector $(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9, 8, 7, \ldots, 2)$.

```{r}
c(seq(from = 2,to = 10,by = 2),seq(from = 9,to = 2))
```

c) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(0,1,\pi,\dots,0,1,\pi)$ in which the sequence $(0,1,\pi)$ is repeated 5 times.

```{r}
rep(c(0,1,pi),times = 5)
```

d) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(1,1,\ldots,1,2,2,\ldots,2,3,3,\ldots,3)$ where each number is repeated 10 times.

```{r}
rep(1:3,each=10)
```

e) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(1,2,2,3,3,3,\ldots,10,\ldots,10)$ where $n$ is repeated $n$ times.

```{r}
rep(1:10,times = 1:10)
```

## Question 2

a) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{100} (2n+1)$$

```{r}
x=1:100
f=x
sum(2*f+1)
```

b) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{20} n^3$$

```{r}
x=1:20
f=x
sum(f^3)
```

c) Compute: $$\sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}$$ 
Hint: Use `factorial(n)` to compute $n!$

```{r}
x=0:10
f=x
sum(1/sqrt(factorial(f)))
```

## Question 3

a) Create an empty list `myList`.

```{r}
myList<-list(0)
myList
```

b) Add a component named `A` whose value is 42.

```{r}
myList<-list(A=42)
myList
```

c) Add a component named `B` whose value is the numeric vector $(2,4,6,8,10)$.

```{r}
myList<-list(A=42,B=c(2,4,6,8,20))
myList
```

d) Add a component named `C` whose value is the character vector ("Hello", "CIND123").

```{r}
myList<-list(A=42,B=c(2,4,6,8,20),C=c("Hello","CIND123"))
myList
```

e) Add a component named `D` whose value is a 4x3 matrix whose elements are $(1,2,\ldots,12)$ in row-major order.

```{r}
myList<-list(A=42,B=c(2,4,6,8,20),C=c("Hello","CIND123"),D=matrix(1:12,4,3,byrow=TRUE))
myList
```

f) Print `myList`.

```{r}
myList
```

## Question 4

If you have not already done so, install the ISwR package on
your computer using the command `install.packages("ISwR")`.

Load the `ISwR` package into your session.
```{r}
library(ISwR)
```

a) Print the head of the `thuesen` data frame with 10 rows.

```{r}
head(thuesen,10)
```

b) Compute the mean of each variable using `sapply()`, removing `NA` values.

```{r}
sapply(thuesen,mean,na.rm = TRUE)
```

c) Create numeric vectors `n1`, `n2`, and `nsr` whose elements are the integers from 1 to 20, their squares, and their square root.

```{r}
n1<-1:20
n2<-(1:20)^2
n3<-sqrt(1:20)
```

d) Create a new data frame `myDataframe` from the above three vectors.

```{r}
myDataframe <-data.frame(n1,n2,n3)
```

e) Print the tail of `myDataframe`.

```{r}
tail(myDataframe)
```

f) Compute the sum and standard deviation of each variable in `myDataframe` using `sapply`.

```{r}

multi.fun <-function(x){c( mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))}
sapply(myDataframe,multi.fun)
```

END of Assignment #1.
